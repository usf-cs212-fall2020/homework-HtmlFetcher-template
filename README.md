HtmlFetcher
=================================================

For this homework, you will download HTML content from web servers. This homework is broken into the following classes:

  - `HttpsFetcher.java`: This is a general HTTP(S) fetcher and is the same as the lecture code.

  - `HtmlFetcher.java`: This is a variant of HTTP(S) fetcher specifically for HTML content. There are a few methods here you must implement.

## Requirements ##

See the Javadoc and `TODO` comments in the template code in the `src/main/java` directory for additional details. You must pass the tests provided in the `src/test/java` directory. Do not modify any of the files in the `src/test` directory.
